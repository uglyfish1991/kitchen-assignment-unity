        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="highlight">"Using the prefabs you created in the course, build a kitchen layout of
            your own design"</p>
            <p> We were tasked with creating a kitchen layout, similar to the guided session. While I have done some programming, visuals, scene building, and navigating 3D elements were new to me. To take away the design element so I could focus on the practical skills, I chose to try and recreate my own home kitchen as closely as I could. I tried to recreate my kitchen to scale, using floorplan measurements, but there were some limitations to what I could achieve based on the prefabs / models I had access to, and my current knowledge of Unity. The images shown have walls missing you you can see from different angels, so some backs of models are exposed.</p>

    <section><h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <p> While I know this isn't good, I'm very pleased with it. As my first effort in working in a 3D space, and creating a recognisable scene, I think I've done a good job. Most people who have been in my kitchen recognised the 3D version! Colours and general placement of prefabs matched my kitchen well - and while there are inaccuracies, they're not terribly jarring!</p>
        <p> I think I used the materials and colours well. We set up a lot of them in the lesson, though I modified some (like the granite) to match my kitchen a bit more. I also brought in some others from a resource Keith shared, but I'm not sure I used them. I found working with the materials and textures of some prefabs a bit confusing, but I think I got there in the end!</p>
        <p>There are many improvements to be made - but I won't be overly critical with the knowledge this is my first try. There are some gaps and alignment issues that I couldn't quite iron out. I also think the scale isn't quite right, though it's not too far off. (My kitchen is very small). I think there are some inconsistencies with the models used. For example, the surfaces and cupboard look quite real, while the kettle is obviously a lower poly model, and this is quite clashy.</p>

        <h2> Further Work</h2>
        <p> With more time, I would like to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add more decorations to the scene to make it look more lived in</li>
            <li>Source or create a proper window. The current window is made of many cubes, and I don't think this is a good approach</li>
            <li>Fix the tiles so they reflect the actual kitchen. They stop too soon, and are too rectangular.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section><h2>Lessons / Takeaways</h2>
        <p> My biggest take away from the project is how difficult I found navigating the 3D space to be. Placing and aligning objects seems very difficult, even with snapping. A surface could look quite well placed from on angle, and the a rotation of your camera shows you're actually half a mile away! I need to work in 3D spaces more to understand the axes more. </p>
